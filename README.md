## LLM-Generated OpenAPI 3.0 Specification & ASP.NET Web API code

This project explores how LLM `o4-mini-high` can:
1. Generate OpenAPI documentation from natural language input.
2. Improve generated OpenAPI documentation
3. Generate C# .NET 8 Minimal API code from improved OpenAPI documentation.

### Experiments

- [Experiment 2 – Improve OpenAPI with LLM](./Experiment2.md)
- [Experiment 3 – OpenAPI → C# Minimal API](./Experiment3.md)

All prompts and outputs are included in the files above. Word document contains 10 page Czech study on this topic.
